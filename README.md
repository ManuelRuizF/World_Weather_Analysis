# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
For this project we integrated the Google Maps API to our code.  
What we did is a code that you would input a range of temperatures, and we would show you the cities in the world that matched those specifications.  
The nearest hotel would pop up as well. This is meant for travelers who want to know about weather conditions before planning a trip.  
In case you mean to visit more than one place we were able to code a route that best matches your specifications.
HereÂ´s an example of the final result of the code:
